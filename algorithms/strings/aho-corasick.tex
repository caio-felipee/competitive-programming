\subsection{Aho-Corasick}

The Aho-Corasick algorithm allows us to quickly search for multiple patterns in a text. The set of pattern strings is also called a \textit{dictionary}. We will denote the total length of its constituent strings by $m$ and the size of the alphabet by $k$.

build: $O(m \cdot k)$

occurrences: $O(|s| + ans)$

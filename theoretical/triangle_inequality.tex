\subsection{Triangle Inequality}

The Triangle Inequality states that if \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers, they will be the measures of the sides of a triangle if, and only if,
\[
a \leq b + c, \quad b \leq a + c, \quad c \leq a + b.
\]

Obs: Equal is valid only if a degenerate triangle is accepted.

\subsubsection{Finding a third side}

If you have two sides $a$ and $b$, the third side $c$ must satisfy:

\[
| a - b | < c < a + b
\]

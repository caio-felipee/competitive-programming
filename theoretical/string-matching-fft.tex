\subsection{String Matching with FFT}

We are given two strings, a text $T$ and a pattern $P$, consisting of lowercase letters. We have to compute all the occurrences of the pattern in the text.

We create a polynomial for each string ($T[i]$ and $P[i]$ are numbers between $0$ and $25$ corresponding to the $26$ letters of the alphabet):

\[A(x) = a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + \dots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}, \quad n = |T|\]

with

\[a_i = \cos(\alpha_i) + i \sin(\alpha_i), \quad \alpha_i = \frac{2 \pi T[i]}{26}\]

And

\[B(x) = b_0 x^0 + b_1 x^1 + \dots + b_{m-1} x^{m-1}, \quad m = |P|\]

with

\[b_i = \cos(\beta_i) - i \sin(\beta_i), \quad \beta_i = \frac{2 \pi P[m-i-1]}{26}\]

Notice that with the expression $P[m-i-1]$ explicitly reverses the pattern.

The $(m-1+i)$th coefficients of the product of the two polynomials $C(x) = A(x) \cdot B(x)$ will tell us, if the pattern appears in the text at position $i$.

If there isn't a match, then at least a character is different, which leads that one of the products $a_{i+1} \cdot b_{m-1-j}$ is not equal to $1$, which leads to the coefficient $c_{m-1+i} \ne m$.

\subsubsection{Wildcards}

This is an extension of the previous problem. This time we allow that the pattern contains the wildcard character $*$, which can match every possible letter.

We create the exact same polynomials, except that we set $b_i = 0$ if $P[m-i-1] = *$. If $x$ is the number of wildcards in $P$, then we will have a match of $P$ in $T$ at index $i$ if $c_{m-1+i} = m - x$.

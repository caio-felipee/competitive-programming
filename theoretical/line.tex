\subsection{Line Equations}

\subsubsection{Reduced Equation}
\[
y = mx + b
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(m\): Slope of the line, calculated as 
    \[
    m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
    \]
    where \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are two distinct points on the line.
    \item \(b\): y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
    \item Easier comparisons between lines.
    \item Cannot represent vertical lines.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General Equation}
\[
Ax + By + C = 0
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(A\), \(B\): Coefficients that define the line's orientation.
    \item \(C\): Constant term that affects the line's position.
    \item Able to represent any line.
\end{itemize}

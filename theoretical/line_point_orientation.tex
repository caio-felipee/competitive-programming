\subsection{Side on which a point lies}

The problem is the following: given a line and a point in the plane, how to determine on which side of the line the point lies?

Let your line be given by \(ax + by + c = 0\). The point you want to check is \((x_1,y_1)\). If \(ax_1 + by_1 + c > 0\), its orientation is \textit{left}. Otherwise, it's \textit{right} (zero means the coordinates are on the line).

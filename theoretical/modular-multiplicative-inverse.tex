\subsection{Modular Multiplicative Inverse}

A modular multiplicative inverse of an integer $a$ is an integer $x$ such that
$a \cdot x$ is congruent to $1$ modular some modulus $m$. To write it in a
formal way:

\[a \cdot x \equiv 1 \mod m.\]

Euler's theorem, which states that the following congruence is true if $a$ and
$m$ are co-primes:

\[a^{\phi (m)} \equiv 1 \mod m\]

Multiply both sides of the above equations by $a^{-1}$, and we get:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For an arbitrary (but coprime) modulus $m$: $a^{\phi(m)-1} \equiv a^{-1}\mod m$
    \item For a prime modulus $m$: $a^{m - 2} \equiv a^{-1} \mod m$
\end{itemize}

From these results, we can easily find the modular inverse using the binary
exponentiation algorithm, which works in $O(\log m)$ time.
